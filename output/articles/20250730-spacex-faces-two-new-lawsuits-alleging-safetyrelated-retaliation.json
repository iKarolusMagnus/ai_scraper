A few months later, he was out of the job.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Markert is one of two former SpaceX employees who have filed separate wrongful-termination lawsuits, both of which were removed to federal court earlier this month.

While Lavalle filed for workers’ compensation for some of these injuries, he did not do so for all for fear of retaliation, the complaint says.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nine days after requesting medical leave for gout-induced knee pain, Lavalle was terminated. Lavalle, who is 60 years old, joined the company in 2014.
