TechCrunch first reported this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/rising-star-defense-tech-startup-mach-industries-is-raising-100-million-sources-say/\">deal was in the works last month</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New investor Keith Rabois from Khosla Ventures joins existing investor Geoff Lewis of Bedrock Capital to lead the round. Existing investor Sequoia also participated. The fresh funding brings the startup’s total raised to about $185 million to date. </p>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mobile ad-unit--has-placeholder ad-unit--display wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot has-background has-gray-100-background-color\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" id=\"us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--desktop ad-unit--native wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" id=\"us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round represents a modest step up from the company’s previous valuation. When Mach announced its Series A funding in October 2023, investors assigned the company a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/defense-startup-mach-industries-closes-79m-series-a-at-335m-valuation/\">$335 million post-money valuation</a>. This means the latest round’s $470 million post-money to pre-money valuation is essentially flat, representing just $35 million in additional value over the past year and a half.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mach Industries’ rise in the defense tech world has been nothing short of meteoric, even if its latest funding round suggests investor enthusiasm is cautious. It was founded in 2023 by then 19-year-old CEO Ethan Thornton, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/mach-industries-founded-by-21-year-old-ethan-thornton-lands-us-army-contract-builds-weapons-factory/\">dropped out of MIT</a> to work full time on the company. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2023, he landed Sequoia’s Stephanie Zhan and Shaun Maguire as investors who led Mach’s $5.7 million seed round. Geoff Lewis, founder of Bedrock Capital, led Mach’s $79 million Series A a few months later.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the last year, Mach has grown from about 20 employees to 140, Thornton tells TechCrunch. The startup has designed three weapons systems: a super light jet-powered vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial vehicle called Viper that requires no runway; a high-altitude glider plane that can strike targets from miles away at the edge of the atmosphere, named Glide; and Stratos an in-air satellite with sensors and communication capabilities that can operate at extreme altitudes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also secured significant contracts and infrastructure investments. Earlier this year, Mach was selected by the Army Applications Laboratory to develop a vertical takeoff precision cruise missile and announced plans for its first factory — a 115,000-square foot facility in Huntington Beach, California.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
