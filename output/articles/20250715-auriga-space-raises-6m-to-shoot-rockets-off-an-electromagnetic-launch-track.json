With rockets, most of the weight is in the propellant, not the payload, and a huge portion of it is burned simply battling Earth’s gravity and atmosphere. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.aurigaspace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Auriga Space</a> is aiming to change the launch game. Instead of a first-stage booster, the California-based startup is developing a launch track that will use electricity to power powerful magnets. Those magnets  will accelerate a small rocket to over six times the speed of sound. The track’s final segment rises on a steep ramp, enabling the rocket to exit at hypersonic speed and only ignite its engine in the final push to orbit. Beyond propellant savings, the entire ground-based architecture is entirely (and rapidly) reusable. </p>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mobile ad-unit--has-placeholder ad-unit--display wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot has-background has-gray-100-background-color\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" id=\"us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--desktop ad-unit--native wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" id=\"us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Less than 2% of the mass of the rocket is what gets into space,” Auriga founder and CEO Winnie Lai explained in a recent interview. “So our ultimate goal here is to make space launch more efficient, and by increasing efficiency, we believe we can bring down the cost, and we can also enable much more frequent launches.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Electromagnetic launchers are not a new idea: Auriga’s architecture is reminiscent to a rail gun or a maglev. But Lai argues that recent advancements in power electronics, especially being able to operate at higher voltages and higher powers, finally make the concept technologically and commercially viable.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is fueling its ambitions with a previously undisclosed $4.6 million seed round that closed at the beginning of the year and $1.4 million in new AFWERX and SpaceWERX contracts. The capital round was led by European firm OTB Ventures, with participation from Trucks Venture Capital and Seraphim Space. Auriga has raised $12.2 million across VC and DOD grants to-date.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The final system architecture, including the tunnel length and rocket size, are still being finalized. Even a very long track will still impart high-G loads on the vehicle, which could limit the types of satellites it can carry. The company has performed some initial studies on the survivability of satellite components under high-G loads that indicate they can survive higher Gs than standard testing assumed, Lai said. Auriga is also considering the opportunity to do “custom work,” like adding some structure support so objects can withstand the higher Gs, depending on what the customer needs. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you look at munitions, you also look at missile launches, those experience very, very, very high Gs,” she said. “So we’re very confident there’s payloads up there that could survive our launch environments, but that’s still yet to be defined. If we want to bring down the Gs, then we make the launcher longer.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
