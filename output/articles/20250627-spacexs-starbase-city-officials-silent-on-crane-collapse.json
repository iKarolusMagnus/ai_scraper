Footage of the accident was <a href=\"https://x.com/LabPadre/status/1937579562998608322\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">captured by Lab Padre</a>, one of the content creators who film and photograph the site on a regular basis.

That’s not surprising; while the company posts details about spaceflight mishaps, like when its Starship rockets blow up, it is otherwise tight-lipped.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But SpaceX’s facility is now part of a newly incorporated city called Starbase, Texas, and this accident happened within its borders. And after one of the Starship rockets <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/19/spacexs-starship-blows-up-ahead-of-10th-test-flight/\">blew up on a test stand</a> last week, Starbase officials <a href=\"https://x.com/StarbaseTX/status/1935784373992714428\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">made a short post on X about it</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There has been no post about the crane collapse, though, and the city has ignored direct appeals for information. TechCrunch has contacted Starbase’s main media email address, its mayor, its two commissioners, its city administrator, and its clerk this week. None have responded to multiple requests for information about the accident.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The collapse is one of the first tests of whether Starbase city has an appetite (and will) for transparency while being run by a SpaceX executive, and acting as a home for the company and more than 200 of its employees. Starbase is also financially beholden to Elon Musk’s spaceflight company: Just this week, the city <a href=\"https://www.valleycentral.com/news/local-news/starbase-borrows-1-5-million-from-spacex/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">finalized</a> a $1.5 million loan from SpaceX to fund the city’s operations through September 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea of making a city called Starbase was first <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309889/elon-musk-city-texas-starbase-starlink\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">floated by Musk in 2021</a>. But it wasn’t until May of this year that it formally became a city. Its citizens — mostly SpaceX employees — voted overwhelmingly to incorporate. SpaceX’s vice president of “Texas Test and Launch,” Bobby Peden, became mayor. The company’s senior director of environmental, health, and safety, Jordan Buss, became a commissioner. The other commissioner, Jenna Petrzelka, worked at SpaceX for years.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
