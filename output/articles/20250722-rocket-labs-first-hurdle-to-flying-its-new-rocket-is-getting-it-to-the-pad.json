The request, which was made in July, is a temporary stopgap while the company awaits federal clearance to dredge a permanent channel to the Wallops Island site.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab plans to launch its Neutron medium-lift rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia, a lower-traffic spaceport that’s surrounded by shallow channels and waterways. The company currently launches its Electron small rocket from this location. </p>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mobile ad-unit--has-placeholder ad-unit--display wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot has-background has-gray-100-background-color\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" id=\"us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--desktop ad-unit--native wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" id=\"us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has a sizable checklist to tick off before Neutron can make its orbital debut, like mating the rocket stages, performing a “wet dress” rehearsal, and getting its launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before any of that can happen, the rocket hardware needs to make it onto the island. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab submitted an application for the dredging project to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission in March. In its application, the company touted the benefits of MARS, noting other launch facilities in Florida and elsewhere are highly congested, which could limit launch cadence. MARS, in contrast, “will allow both frequent launch cadence and the return-to-Earth capability of recovering boosters,” Rocket Lab said at the time.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite that upside, MARS is constrained in a crucial way: Existing maritime infrastructure is limited, and access to the channel — called Sloop Gut — depends on favorable tides. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Rocket Lab and its co-applicant, Virginia Port Authority, notes in its request, “there is no permanent existing means of providing safe and reliable access for large infrastructure deliveries to Wallops Island.” (Electron is substantially smaller and delivered via road.)  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
