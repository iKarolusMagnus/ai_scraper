# Jeff Bezos is reportedly courting Trump after public spat with Musk
## 
Jeff Bezos is apparently trying to capitalize on the recent blowup between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal.

Bezos has spoken to Trump twice this month, at times discussing more government contracts for his space company Blue Origin, according to the report. Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp also visited the White House to meet with Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles. Bezos even reportedly invited Trump to his upcoming wedding in Venice, Italy.

The interactions with the White House came after Musk and Trump spent days slinging mud at each other on social media. The SpaceX founder claimed the president is “in the Epstein files” and claimed that was why they “have not been made public.” Trump, meanwhile, threatened to take away “billions and billions of dollars” in government subsidies and contracts that go to Musk’s companies.

While that feud quickly cooled, Bezos seems to have sensed an opportunity for Blue Origin — especially after Trump pulled the nomination of Musk’s preferred choice to lead NASA. Musk has pushed hard to focus SpaceX (and NASA) on missions to Mars, while Blue Origin’s near-term plans are more oriented around missions to the moon. In the recent conversations, Trump “has discussed with Bezos his desire to see a crewed mission to the moon during his term in office,” according to the report.
