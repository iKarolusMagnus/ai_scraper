The scale and complexity made these projects perpetually “20 years away,” Bhatt said Wednesday night. “Everything was too big . . .The size of the array, the size of the spacecraft was the size of a small city. That’s real science fiction stuff.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His solution is both far smaller and more nimble, he suggested. Most notably, instead of massive microwave antennas that require precise phase coordination, Aetherflux’s satellites will use fiber lasers, essentially converting solar power back into focused light that can be precisely targeted at receivers on the ground.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We take the solar power that we collect from the sun with solar panels, and we take that energy and put it into a set of diodes that turn it back into light,” Bhatt said. “That light goes into a fiber where there’s a laser, which then lets us point that down to the ground.”</p>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mobile ad-unit--has-placeholder ad-unit--display wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot has-background has-gray-100-background-color\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" id=\"us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--desktop ad-unit--native wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" id=\"us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea is to launch a demonstration satellite in June of next year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>National security, first</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bhatt envisions eventually building “a true industrial-scale energy company,” he’s starting with national defense. In fact, the Department of Defense has approved funding for Aetherflux’s program, recognizing the military value of beaming power to forward bases without the logistical nightmare of transporting fuel. “It allows the U.S. to have energy out in the battlefield,” Bhatt explained.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The precision Bhatt is promising is remarkable. Aetherflux’s initial target is a laser spot “bigger than 10 meters diameter” on the ground, but Bhatt believes they can shrink it to “five to 10 meters, potentially even smaller than that.” These compact, lightweight receivers would be “of little to no strategic value if captured by an adversary” and “small enough and portable enough that you can literally bring them out into the battlefield.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While much remains to be seen — pretty much the whole shebang, really —  success for Aetherflux could potentially change the game for American military operations worldwide. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3020469\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"454\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54599380127_df4ede7c18_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Slava Blazer Photography / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So why hasn’t someone already done what Aetherflux is attempting? As <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/startup-takes-new-approach-to-space-based-solar-power/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">noted last year</a> in Space News, a <a href=\"https://space.nss.org/wp-content/uploads/Space-Based-Solar-Power-Opportunity-for-Strategic-Security-assessment.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2007 study</a> found promise in the approach and recommended more research, but no one acted on the report (Bhatt said he wasn’t aware of it). Either way, to Bhatt, it’s the kind of overlooked opportunity that an outsider is well-positioned to seize. Indeed, in addition to his own father, Bhatt said that he draws inspiration from someone else who has proved that if you’re curious and willing to work hard, you can master multiple industries: Elon Musk. That outsider perspective “is actually an advantage,” Bhatt told the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, unlike the iterate-fast mentality of companies like Robinhood that can roll out, and also sometimes <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/robinhood-gets-rid-of-confetti-feature-amid-scrutiny-over-gamification.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">roll back</a>, software features, space hardware involves much higher stakes. You only get one shot when your satellite launches.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We build one spacecraft, we bolt it to the fairing inside of the SpaceX rocket, we put it in space, and it detaches, and then the thing better work,” Bhatt said. “You can’t go up there and tighten the bolt.”</p>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mobile ad-unit--has-placeholder ad-unit--display wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot has-background has-gray-100-background-color\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_mw_mid_center\" id=\"us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--desktop ad-unit--native wp-block-tc-ads-ad-slot\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__ad\" data-test=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" data-unitcode=\"us_tc_ros_dt_native_midarticle\" id=\"us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked during the sit-down how he pressure-tests that spacecraft, Bhatt said that Aetherflux is pursuing a “hardware-rich” approach, which means building and testing components while refining designs. “The right balance is not waiting five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, as is the case with many important space programs,” he said. “People’s careers are oftentimes shorter than that.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also noted that if Aetherflux succeeds, the implications extend far beyond military applications.

That plan to launch a demonstration satellite precisely one year from now means that it’s basically around the corner.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there’s a prototype for Bhatt’s approach.
