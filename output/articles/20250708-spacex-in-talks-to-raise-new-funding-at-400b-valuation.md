# SpaceX in talks to raise new funding at $400B valuation
## 
SpaceX is looking to raise fresh capital by selling new shares to insiders in a deal that would boost its valuation to around $400 billion, according to reporting from Bloomberg.

The company’s strategy is to raise money via a fundraising round and separately hold a tender offer to allow employees to sell some of their shares to a select group of investors, anonymous sources told Bloomberg. SpaceX typically holds tender offers twice per year.

SpaceX’s valuation has steadily climbed since the company was founded more than two decades ago. The company broke the $100 billion valuation mark in October 2021 and doubled that figure just three years later. This latest round would represent a major jump from the $350 billion valuation set during the tender offer held in December 2024.

Discussions are still ongoing, and the deal, including the final price, could change.
