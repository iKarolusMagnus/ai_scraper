And while it has incurred negative cash flows and losses from operations, Firefly projected that its cash is adequate to meet its liquidity needs for at least 12 months. <br/><br/>The company does have a lot of debt: about $173.6 million, including a $136.1 million term loan with a 13.87% interest rate. The net proceeds from the IPO will be used in part to repay that outstanding loan, according to the S-1. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Firefly reportedly scored $55.8 million in revenue as of March 31, up from just $8.3 million for the same period in 2024. The majority of that — around $50 million — is from “spacecraft solutions,” or its Blue Ghost lander missions, and just $5 million from launch. But hardware is an expensive endeavor, and Firefly is still burning a lot of money: The cost of sales, or incurred expenses, was nearly as much as revenue — about $53 million as of March 31, leaving just $2.2 million in gross profit. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company operated at a net loss of $231.1 million for the 2024 fiscal year, up from $135.5 million in 2023. Its net losses at the end of the first quarter were $60.1 million. <br/><br/>Yet the company tells prospective investors that it sees nothing but growth ahead, and there’s a handful of huge developments in the pipeline that could prove that to be true. That includes <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/northrop-grumman-taps-firefly-aerospace-to-upgrade-its-antares-rocket-to-american-built-engines/\">a major partnership</a> with defense giant Northrop Grumman for a new, reusable launch vehicle called Eclipse, a launch agreement for up to 25 launches with Lockheed Martin, and the impending commercial debut of Elytra, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/firefly-debuts-elytra-orbital-transfer-vehicles/\">a spacecraft line</a> designed for in-space transportation services. <br/><br/>The company also cited strong customer demand, noting that as of March 31 it had about $1.1 billion worth of backlogged launch orders and spacecraft contracts. That’s about double from the $560 million in backlogged orders it had from a year prior. That big boost came from three multi-launch agreements for Firefly’s small Alpha rocket and an additional lunar delivery contract for its Blue Ghost lander. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The regulatory document also states Firefly intends to be a “controlled company” — essentially, that it will leverage Nasdaq rules to ensure that AE Industrial Partners, the private equity firm that bought a majority stake in Firefly in 2022, will retain significant governance control over the company even after it is listed on the public markets. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company intends to list on the Nasdaq Global Markets under the ticker symbol $FLY. The news comes after a relative quiet period of space company exits. There was a slew of space companies that went public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies in 2021 and 2022, many of which have failed to perform. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
