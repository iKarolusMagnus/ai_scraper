Collins discouraged reporting security clearance violations and allowed executives without proper clearances into classified meetings, according to the NYT. This and other allegations triggered at least three federal reviews of the company’s security procedures, the NYT found. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25988273-shumway-vs-spacex/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Shumway’s complaint</a>, she was passed over for the director position that Collins ultimately was hired for without being given the opportunity to apply for it. Her “work environment entirely changed” when Collins was hired as her superior in spring 2024, according to the complaint. Shumway claims Collins effectively waged a campaign of harassment against her, which included stripping her of her responsibilities over a period of months and ultimately leading to her termination in October 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Collins’ harassment extended to other female employees, too, the complaint alleges. The discrimination included preventing female staff from doing required security work, allegedly setting them up for noncompliance, staring at one employee’s chest during a meeting, and asking a subordinate female employee if she wanted to “get s–tty together” over after-work drinks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shumway and other female employees repeatedly reported Collins to SpaceX human resources, the lawsuit states. The company ignored these complaints, the suit alleges, and didn’t take any action beyond suggesting the employees avoid being alone with Collins. Shumway is seeking unspecified damages.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
